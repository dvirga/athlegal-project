        <p class="bio1">I have to get something off my chest. I love sports. Not that surprising right? After all, who does not like sports? The difference is – I love them. I do not love one team or one sport – I love them all and I love everything about them. I love the overblown drama, the nail-biting final minutes, the highs, and the lows – I even love the boring stuff like assessing player discipline and labour disputes.<br><br>
          What really draws me towards the study and practice of sport is that it is multi-faceted and unpredictable. Eric Macramella, my former Sports Law professor and TSN Legal Analyst, always told us “There is no such thing as Sports Law!” Rather, as he explained, Sports Law is Immigration Law, Criminal Law, Labour Law, etc. – it really involves any type of law that intersects with a sport. Perhaps the best thing about sports is that it unifies and grounds both its actors and concepts. For instance, while I would not dare to touch a matter involving Immigration Law in my daily practice, when it pertains to sports, it somehow becomes more approachable and understandable. Therein lies the beauty of sports.<br><br>
          It was while completing my Juris Doctor Degree from the University of Ottawa where I first discovered my love for Sports Law. I quickly joined the uOttawa Sports and Entertainment Law Society, where I first served as Treasurer before being elected as President. While others were competing in Business Law or Family Law mooting competitions – I was twice chosen to represent the University at the Hockey Arbitration Competition of Canada. The competition involved a simulation of an NHL salary arbitration proceeding, tasking competitors with advocating for either the player or the team in front of an arbitrator. Competing in this Competition acted as the culmination of my two greatest passions: the law and sports. I was instantly hooked.<br><br>
          So that’s why I – a busy Lawyer, who spends his days (and some evenings) assisting business-owners with their Labour and Employment needs, decided it was high time to share my insights on Sports Law.
          I hope you enjoy embarking on this journey with us. I know we will.<p>

        <h3>BRANDON LOEHLE</h3>
        <img class="images" src="images/Bloehle.jpg" alt="author2" width="240" height="300">
        <p>For a long time I have been fascinated with the idea of combining my life-long love of sports with my passion for the law.<br><br>
          Growing up I was constantly around sports, even though my aspirations to go professional were unrealistic before hitting puberty. I realistically hit my peak as a 12 year-old hockey player scoring a rare hat-trick or as I snagged my lone interception in a high school football game. Sure, I was a two-time C-division intramural basketball champion in University and my volleyball team made it to the B-division playoffs, but I knew the pros were never right for me. Nevertheless I have always had a desire to stay close to sports, but I was not sure how I could do it.<br><br>
          After successful stints with my high school soccer and football teams I went to Wilfred Laurier University to obtain a Degree in Psychology, with a minor in Criminology, before earning a Juris Doctor Degree from Queen’s University. I was first exposed to Sports Law while working at the Queen’s Business Law Clinic. At the Clinic, I was given the opportunity to assist clients with their business-related inquiries relating to both Sports and Entertainment Law. Realizing how much the law can impact athletes, I was able to scratch that itch of wanting to stay close to sports.<br><br>
          I have completed research and assisted in matters involving human rights, unionization, collective bargaining, labour arbitration, and employment contracts. As a lawyer licensed to practice in Ontario, and with some experience under my belt, I think now is the perfect time to leverage this exposure and analyze how these same issues impact athletes.<br><br>
          Am I trying to live vicariously through successful athletes more gifted than myself? Probably. Regardless, I believe my legal knowledge and sport insight uniquely position me to analyze the intricacies of the behind-the-scenes policies that shape the games we love to watch.
          I hope you find this passion-project as riveting as we do.<p>
